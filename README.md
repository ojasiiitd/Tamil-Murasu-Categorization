# Tamil-Murasu-Categorization

Working on categorizing Tamil articles using data from the Tamil Murasu newspaper. The Kaggle Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayabhaskar96/tamil-news-classification-dataset-tamilmurasu).

Used the [IndicNLP](https://github.com/anoopkunchukuttan/indic_nlp_library) library to tokenise and perform morphological analysis on the corpus.
